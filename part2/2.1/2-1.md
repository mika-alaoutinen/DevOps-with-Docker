Note that the image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` has to be available locally. Running `docker-compose up` without the image leads to an error
```
failed to solve with frontend dockerfile.v0: failed to read dockerfile: open /var/lib/docker/tmp/buildkit-mount650161381/Dockerfile: no such file or directory
```

The solution:
> docker pull devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service

> docker-compose up
